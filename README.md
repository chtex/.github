**CHTEX** is an end-to-end encrypted communication platform designed for secure, private, and community-based chatting. It offers server-based organization, voice and text channels, and user roles â€” all without compromising user privacy.

**(Still in early Development and closed Source at the moment)**

## Why did you make CHTEX?

Most mainstream chat platforms are centralized, collect user data, and often impose limitations or policies that don't align with user freedom or privacy. I created CHTEX because I want:

- **End-to-end encryption by default**
- **No data collection or surveillance**
- **Free Speech**
- **Nothing thats run by (((them)))**
